# A simple OpenGL based renderer

As mentioned, a simple renderer written using OpenGL specification, intended to be a summer project. Expect nothing fancy. Not blazing fast, even though I believe in performant code is always good code, and I will try to optimize it as much as possible, I don't trust much in my capabilities xD

### Compiling and Running
